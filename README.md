## Overview
The **Robotics Knowledgebase** is the Wiki for Robot Builders. It exists to advance knowledge in the robotics discipline. We document and share application details left out of textbooks and academic papers.

This Knowledgebase holds knowledge essential to building working robots. We believe robots should be built to solve specific problems. We take a systems-based approach to creating them. We include Project Management practices to ensure project completion.
